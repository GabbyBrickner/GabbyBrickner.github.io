			<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Hey There!</h2>
			<tr><td><p style="font-family:verdana;">My name is <b>Gabby Brickner</b>, and I am currently a sophomore here 
			at the University of Georgia studying Marketing! I just recently got admitted to the Terry 
			College of Business this October, so I am very excited to begin my major-specific courses in the spring of 2019!
			I am originally from North Carolina, but have moved, and traveled, around the country for the
			majority of my life. However, I moved to Georgia about four years ago to be closer to my family, and that is
			where I discovered my love for sculpting.</p>
					<p style="font-family:verdana;">During my senior year of high school, I got the chance to learn the art of pottery and sculpting.
					Although I haven't had the time to join a studio up here in Athens, I would love more than anything
					to start creating pottery again! While still in high school, I competed at the district and state levels in District Project
					Achievement as a senior 4Her in the Arts & Crafts category, and earned the first place spot at both!
					In this competition, 4hers across Georgia produced various demonstrations within their category of 
					choice, and I chose to do a demonstration on the various glazing techniques that are presently, 
					as well as most commonly, used in modern pottery and sculpting practices.</p></td>
