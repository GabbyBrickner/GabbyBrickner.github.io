			<tr><td><p>My name is Gabby Brickner, and I am currently a sophomore here 
			at the University of Georgia studying Marketing! I just recently got admitted to the Terry 
			College of Business this October, so I am very excited to begin my major-specific courses in the spring!</p>
					<p>I am originally from North Carolina, but have moved, and traveled, around the country for the
					majority of my life. However, I moved to Georgia about four years ago to be closer to my family.</p>
					<p>During my senior year of high school, I got the chance to learn the art of pottery and sculpting.
					Although I haven't had the time to join a studio up here in Athens, I would love more than anything
					to start creating pottery again! Here are some of my favorite creations from a few years ago!</p>
